The windows operating system to  me is the best system when operating a computer. It is not a great system when operating a mobile cell phone. The reason for me saying this is windows always updates and keeps on its updates. It is quick and effiecient. The operating system has a lot of ram and storage for someone like me to use. 
Another operating system is mac os. I have never and will never like apple products. they are ridicoulously hard to operate. the apps are no were near what google and windows offers. the apps are all genreic wankers in my terms.
